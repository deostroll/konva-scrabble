# Fiddle!

This fiddle creates a simple blank scrabble board. You can use it to mark bonus tiles and then retrieve that data in a JSON format.

To run the project you'd need node-js based tools.

- grunt-cli
- bower


1. Clone this repo

2. In the folder where it downloaded,type `npm install` to install depedencies

3. Install bower dependencies: `bower install`

4. After that wire your bower dependencies and run the app: `grunt wiredep && grunt`. Browse the app: `http://localhost:3000`
